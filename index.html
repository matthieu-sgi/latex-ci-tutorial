    <h1>Welcome to my latex master thesis compilation tutorial</h1>
    <h2>I- Get your master thesis from overleaf</h2>
    <p>First, you need to get your master thesis from overleaf. You can download it as a zip file.
        Go to overleaf, click on the menu icon on the top left corner: <br>
        <!-- include image  -->
        <img class="big-picture" src="media/overleaf_modified.png" alt="overleaf menu">
    </p>
    <p>
        Then click on the source button.<br>
        <img src="media/menu_modified.png" alt="overleaf source" >
        <br>
        and it will download the zip file for you.
    </p>
    <h2>II- Create a Github repo</h2>
    <p>Go to github and create a new repository. You can name it whatever you want.</p>
    <p>Clone the repo to your local computer. Then unzip the zip file from Overleaf in this repo</p>

    <h2>III- Add Github actions (CI)</h2>
    <p>
        Now, it is time to create the CI (Continuous Integration) files that will compile the doc for you. <br>
        Create a new folder in the root of your repo and name it "<strong>.github</strong>"" (the "." before is important).<br>
        Inside this folder, create a new folder named <strong>workflows</strong>.
        Example: <br>
        <img src="media/dir_example_modified.png" alt="github folder">
    </p>
    <p>
        Inside the workflows folder, create a new file named <strong>compile-latex.yml</strong>.<br>
	Put the content of <strong><a href="./compile-latex.yml">this file</a></strong> in the newly created file.
    </p>
    <p>Now, push the changes to your repo. Go to the actions tab in your repo and you will see the CI running.</p>
    <h2>IV- Download the compiled PDF</h2>
    <p>Once the CI is done, you can download the compiled PDF from the "Actions" tab on github.<br>
      <img src="media/github_modified.png" alt="gihub repo homepage">
    </p>
    <p>Click on the latest CI run (workflows). It has to bee green and not still running to have the PDF.<br>
      Then go on the "Artifacts" part. You will see the PDF file there. Click on it to download it.<br>
      <img src="media/ci_panel_modifed.png" alt="artifact"><br>
      Your PDF is available for 30 days here.
